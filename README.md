# AI-Enhanced PDF Scholar

An intelligent platform to streamline academic literature review.

## üìñ Project Goal & Motivation

This project aims to create an intelligent platform that streamlines the laborious process of academic literature review. It was conceived to eliminate the constant context-switching and manual copy-pasting required when analyzing academic papers with AI, providing a unified and efficient research environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Highlights

*   **Decoupled System**: Architected as a highly decoupled system, it serves both a **PyQt6** desktop application and a **FastAPI** web user interface from a single core backend logic layer.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Features a robust RAG pipeline, powered by **LlamaIndex**, enabling intelligent and context-aware interactions with PDF documents.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes asynchronous `QThreads` for handling long-running AI tasks, ensuring a fluid and responsive user experience in the desktop application.
*   **Iterative Development**: The project is a product of multiple refactoring cycles, emphasizing the importance of thorough requirements analysis and flexible architectural planning for robust software development.
