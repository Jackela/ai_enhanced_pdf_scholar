# AI-Enhanced PDF Scholar

An intelligent document library platform with persistent RAG database and advanced duplicate detection for academic literature management.

## 📖 Project Goal & Motivation

This project aims to create an intelligent platform that streamlines the laborious process of academic literature review. It was conceived to eliminate the constant context-switching and manual copy-pasting required when analyzing academic papers with AI, providing a unified and efficient research environment.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **📚 Document Library Management**: Complete document organization with SQLite database persistence
*   **🔍 Intelligent Duplicate Detection**: File-level and content-level duplicate detection to prevent reprocessing
*   **💾 Persistent RAG Database**: Vector indexes are stored and reused, eliminating the need to reprocess identical content
*   **🏷️ Smart Import System**: Automatic metadata extraction, hash-based deduplication, and integrity verification
*   **📊 Comprehensive Statistics**: Document library analytics, health monitoring, and cleanup tools
*   **🧪 Production-Grade Architecture**: Repository pattern, service layers, and comprehensive test coverage
*   **🚀 Enterprise CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete Phase 3 advanced CI/CD with performance monitoring, security scanning, deployment automation, and E2E validation

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Highlights

*   **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation with Database → Repository → Service → UI layers following SOLID principles
*   **Thread-Safe Database**: SQLite with connection pooling, transaction management, and migration system
*   **Repository Pattern**: Generic data access layer with specialized repositories for documents and vector indexes
*   **Content Hashing**: MD5-based file and content hashing for intelligent duplicate detection
*   **Decoupled System**: Serves both **PyQt6** desktop and **FastAPI** web interfaces from unified backend
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: **LlamaIndex**-powered RAG with persistent vector storage
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking `QThreads` for responsive user experience
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks

    uvicorn web_main:app --reload
    ```

## 📚 Document Library Features

### Smart Document Import

```python
from src.services.document_library_service import DocumentLibraryService
from src.database.connection import DatabaseConnection

# Initialize service
db = DatabaseConnection("library.db")
library = DocumentLibraryService(db)

# Import document with duplicate detection
doc = library.import_document(
    "path/to/paper.pdf",
    title="Research Paper",
    check_duplicates=True
)
```

### Advanced Search & Organization

```python
# Search documents
results = library.get_documents(search_query="machine learning")

# Get recent documents
recent = library.get_recent_documents(limit=10)

# Find duplicates
duplicates = library.find_duplicate_documents()

# Library statistics
stats = library.get_library_statistics()
```

### Database Features

- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent access with proper locking
- **Transaction Support**: ACID compliance with automatic rollback

    file_path TEXT,
    file_hash TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,

    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_accessed TEXT,
    metadata TEXT DEFAULT '{}'
);

CREATE TABLE vector_indexes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    document_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    index_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    index_hash TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    chunk_count INTEGER,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (document_id) REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Document tagging system
CREATE TABLE tags (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    color TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE document_tags (
    document_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    tag_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (document_id, tag_id),
