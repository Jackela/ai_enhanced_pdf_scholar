# Product Roadmap: AI Enhanced PDF Scholar

This document outlines the high-level strategic direction for AI Enhanced PDF Scholar. Our priorities are guided by our core mission to streamline the academic research workflow and are subject to change based on user feedback and market dynamics.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Framework

We use a **Now, Next, Later** framework to communicate our priorities.

- **Now:** What we are currently focused on developing.
- **Next:** What we plan to work on in the near future. These are our next big priorities.
- **Later:** What we envision for the future. These ideas are less defined and are subject to research and discovery.

## üöÄ Now (Currently in Development)

*   **Enhanced Document Viewer:** Introducing a more powerful and interactive PDF viewer that supports text highlighting and user annotations.
    *   *Why:* To allow users to work more deeply with their documents directly within the platform.
*   **GraphQL API Endpoint:** Developing a GraphQL API to allow for more flexible and efficient data queries from the frontend and third-party clients.
    *   *Why:* To support a more complex and feature-rich user interface and empower power-users.
*   **Extensible Plugin System:** Building an underlying architecture that will allow for custom document processors and analysis tools.
    *   *Why:* To future-proof the platform and enable a community-driven ecosystem of features.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next (Upcoming Priorities)

*   **Collaboration Features:** Introducing shared workspaces where teams can manage a common library of documents.
    *   *Why:* Based on feedback from research labs who need to collaborate on literature reviews.
*   **Advanced User Analytics:** Providing researchers with insights into their reading habits and highlighting trends within their personal library.
    *   *Why:* To provide more value and help users identify research gaps and opportunities.
*   **Official Cloud Deployment Options:** Offering well-documented and supported deployment configurations for major cloud providers like AWS and Azure.
    *   *Why:* To make the platform more accessible to institutional users and larger research groups.

## üåÖ Later (Future Exploration)

*   **Native Mobile Application:** A companion mobile app for iOS and Android for on-the-go access to research libraries.
    *   *Why:* To make the platform accessible from anywhere, on any device.
*   **Public Database Integration:** Exploring integration with public academic databases (like Google Scholar, PubMed, ArXiv) to search for and import papers directly.
    *   *Why:* To further streamline the research process by bringing literature discovery into the platform.
*   **Proactive Research Assistant:** Leveraging AI to provide proactive suggestions, such as recommending relevant papers based on a user's library or highlighting emerging themes in their field.
    *   *Why:* To evolve from a reactive tool to a proactive research partner.
