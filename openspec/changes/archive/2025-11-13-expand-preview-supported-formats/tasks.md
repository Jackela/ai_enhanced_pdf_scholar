## Tasks
1. [x] Document current preview limitations (supported file types, error codes) as a baseline.
2. [x] Evaluate conversion options (LibreOffice, unoconv, cloud services) including licensing/perf trade-offs.
3. [x] Draft spec deltas describing the new behaviour per file type, plus config/env flags and failure handling.
4. [x] Capture operational considerations (resource limits, sandboxing, cleanup) in `design.md`.
5. [x] Run `openspec validate expand-preview-supported-formats --strict` before sharing the proposal.
