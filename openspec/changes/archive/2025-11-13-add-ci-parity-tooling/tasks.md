## Tasks
- [x] Inventory current lint/type violations (Ruff categories, MyPy errors) and capture them in `design.md`.
- [x] Propose staged cleanup approach (per-directory or per-rule) and document it.
- [x] Define `make` targets / scripts for CI parity (e.g., `make lint`, `make lint-staged`) and describe tool configs (pre-commit, Ruff settings).
- [x] Update developer docs explaining the required local workflow.
- [x] Run `openspec validate add-ci-parity-tooling --strict` before sharing.
