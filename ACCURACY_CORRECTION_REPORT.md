- **After**: Qualitative assessments ("表现良好", "控制良好")

**Quality Claims**:
- **Before**: "已验证向后兼容", "100%核心功能测试覆盖，质量达到商业级别"
- **After**: "设计为不破坏现有功能的升级路径", "核心功能测试覆盖良好，质量持续优化中"

**Added Disclaimer**: "重要提示：性能数据基于开发环境测试，生产环境性能可能因硬件配置、数据量和并发负载而有所不同。"

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. Evidence-Based Language
- Replaced specific unverified numbers with qualitative terms
- Changed absolute claims to relative improvements
- Removed unsupported percentage metrics

### 2. Honest Status Reporting
- Changed "已完成" (completed) to "基本完成" (basically completed) for partial implementations
- Changed "已验证" (verified) to "基于当前实现" (based on current implementation)
- Used "🚧" (under construction) instead of "✅" (completed) for ongoing work

### 3. Conservative Performance Claims
- Replaced "X倍提升" with "改进" or "优化"
- Removed specific timing claims without benchmarking evidence
- Added environment disclaimers for all performance metrics

### 4. Professional Transparency
- Added disclaimers about development vs production environment differences
- Maintained technical accuracy while being honest about limitations
- Preserved achievements while correcting overstated claims

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Changes
- **Increased Credibility**: Documentation now reflects realistic project status
- **Better Expectations**: Users have accurate expectations about system capabilities
- **Professional Standards**: Adheres to evidence-based documentation practices
- **Maintainability**: Claims can be substantiated and updated as needed

### Preserved Elements
- All technical architecture and design information remained intact
- Feature descriptions and implementation details preserved
- Project goals and roadmap maintained
- Development practices and methodologies kept

## Recommendations for Future Documentation

1. **Measurement Before Claims**: Implement benchmarking before making performance claims
2. **Regular Auditing**: Review documentation quarterly for accuracy drift
3. **Evidence Requirements**: Require evidence for any quantified claims
4. **Peer Review**: Have technical claims reviewed by team members
5. **Environment Specificity**: Always specify which environment claims apply to

## Conclusion

The documentation corrections successfully removed 15+ exaggerated claims while maintaining the professional quality and technical accuracy of the project documentation. The changes shift from promotional language to honest, evidence-based reporting that will serve the project better in the long term.
