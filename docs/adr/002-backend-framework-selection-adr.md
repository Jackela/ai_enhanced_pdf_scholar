# 2. Backend Framework Selection: FastAPI

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-08-15

## Context

For the AI Enhanced PDF Scholar backend, we require a Python web framework to build our core API. The key requirements for this framework are:
1.  **High Performance:** The ability to handle a significant number of concurrent requests efficiently, especially for I/O-bound operations like RAG queries which involve network calls to external AI services.
2.  **Modern Python Features:** The framework should leverage modern Python features, particularly `async/await` for asynchronous operations and type hints for robust, maintainable code.
3.  **Excellent Developer Experience:** The framework should be easy to learn, promote rapid development, and include features that reduce boilerplate code, such as automatic documentation and data validation.
4.  **Strong Ecosystem:** It should have good support for common plugins and middleware for security, CORS, and other web-related concerns.

The primary candidates considered were **FastAPI**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, and **Flask**.

## Decision

We have decided to use **FastAPI** as the web framework for our backend API.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Exceptional Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, with performance comparable to Go and Node.js. This is due to its use of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation, both built on top of the `asyncio` library.
- **Native Async Support:** First-class support for `async` and `await` is fundamental to FastAPI. This is critical for our application, which relies on I/O-bound tasks like communicating with the Google Gemini API and database queries. Async support allows us to handle many concurrent requests without blocking.
- **Automatic Interactive Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) from our code. This significantly improves developer productivity and makes our API easy to explore and test.
- **Built-in Data Validation:** The integration with Pydantic provides powerful, type-hint-based data validation for all incoming requests. This catches errors early, reduces boilerplate validation code, and makes the API more robust and secure.
- **Dependency Injection System:** FastAPI's dependency injection system is simple yet powerful, making it easy to manage dependencies (like database sessions or service classes) and write clean, testable code.

### Negative (Trade-offs):
- **Newer Ecosystem:** Compared to Django and Flask, the FastAPI ecosystem is younger. While it is growing rapidly, there may be fewer mature, third-party plugins for certain niche functionalities.
- **Learning Curve for Async:** For developers not already familiar with Python's `asyncio`, there is a learning curve. Writing and debugging asynchronous code can be more complex than traditional synchronous programming.
- **Less "Batteries-Included" than Django:** Unlike Django, FastAPI is a micro-framework and does not come with a built-in ORM, admin panel, or other components. While this provides more flexibility, it also means we have to select and integrate these components ourselves (e.g., SQLAlchemy for the ORM). We view this as an acceptable trade-off for our use case.
