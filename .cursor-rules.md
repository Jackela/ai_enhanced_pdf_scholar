## AI-Enhanced PDF Scholar - Development Rules

This document outlines the coding standards, architectural principles, and development workflow for the AI-Enhanced PDF Scholar project. All contributions must adhere to these guidelines to ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration efficiency.

### 1. Core Principles (CRITICAL)

- **Language:** All user-facing communication will be in Chinese. All code, including variable names, function names, class names, comments, and string literals, **must be in English**.
- **SOLID Principles:**
    - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Every class or module must have only one reason to change. Components should be highly cohesive.
    - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Use abstractions (ABCs) and interfaces.
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not depend on methods they don't use.
    - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not on low-level modules. Both depend on abstractions.
- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling:** Components must be self-contained with minimal dependencies on others. Communication should happen through well-defined interfaces and signals.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Prefer object composition to class inheritance for code reuse and flexibility.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code and logic.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Strive for simplicity and clarity.
- **Avoid Static Obsession:** Do not overuse static methods or global functions. Prefer class instances and dependency injection to manage state and behavior, which is crucial for testability.

### 2. Code Style & Quality

- **Style Guide:** Strictly follow PEP 8 for all Python code.
- **Readability:**
    - Use clear, descriptive, and unambiguous English names for all identifiers.
    - Avoid magic values; use named constants or enums.
    - Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.
- **Error Handling:**
    - **No Silent Failures:** Errors must be handled explicitly. Do not use empty `except` blocks.
    - **Fail Fast:** Raise exceptions immediately when an error is detected.
    - **Specific Exceptions:** Use specific, custom exception classes where appropriate (e.g., `PDFLoadError`, `LLMQueryError`) instead of returning error strings. This provides a clear contract for functions.
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable objects where possible to reduce side effects.

### 3. Architecture & Design

- **Modularity:** The application is divided into functionally distinct modules:
    - **`main.py` (Orchestrator):** Initializes and connects all components. Contains the main application window logic.
    - **`pdf_document.py` (Model):** Encapsulates all PDF processing logic (loading, rendering, text extraction) via the `PyMuPDF` library. It has **no dependency on PyQt**.
    - **`pdf_viewer.py` (View):** Responsible only for displaying the rendered PDF page and capturing user input (mouse events for selection). It emits signals upon user actions but does not orchestrate other UI components.
    - **`annotation_manager.py` (Controller):** Manages the lifecycle of annotation widgets, including creation, positioning, and persistence.
    - **`llm_service.py` (Service):** Defines the abstract interface for LLM interaction and provides concrete implementations.
    - **UI Components (`inquiry_popup.py`, `annotation.py`, `settings_dialog.py`):** Self-contained UI widgets.
- **Decoupling with Signals/Slots:** Use PyQt's signal and slot mechanism for communication between decoupled components (e.g., `PDFViewer` signals a text selection, `MainWindow` reacts).
- **Dependency Injection:** Dependencies (like `LLMService`, `AnnotationManager`, `PDFDocument`) should be passed into the constructor of the classes that use them. This is essential for testability.

### 4. Documentation

- **Docstrings:** All public modules, classes, and functions must have JSDoc/DbC-style docstrings in English. The format should be clear and structured, explaining the purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. This is for both human and AI readability.
- **Metadata:** For key classes, include structured metadata in the docstring to aid AI-powered tools.
  ```python
  class MyClass:
      """
      {
          "name": "MyClass",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "description": "A brief description of the class.",
          "dependencies": ["DependencyOne", "DependencyTwo"],
          "interface": {
              "inputs": [{"name": "param1", "type": "string"}],
              "outputs": "boolean"
          }
      }
      A more detailed human-readable description follows.
      @param {string} param1 - Description of param1.
      @returns {boolean} - Description of the return value.
      @raises {CustomError} - When a specific error occurs.
      """
  ```
- **Architectural Documents:** The `DESIGN.md` and `README.md` files must be kept up-to-date with any significant changes to the architecture or functionality.
- **Authoritative Documentation:** When dealing with external libraries or APIs (e.g., PyQt6, Gemini API), actively use tools like the `Context7 MCP` to retrieve the latest, most authoritative documentation. Do not rely solely on prior knowledge, which may be outdated.

### 5. Testing

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Adopt a TDD-like approach. New features or refactored components must be accompanied by unit tests.
- **Testability:** The architecture (DI, modularity) is designed to make components independently testable.
- **Mocking:** Use mocking libraries (like `unittest.mock`) to isolate components under test from their dependencies (e.g., network calls, filesystem).
- **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage on core logic modules (`pdf_document.py`, `llm_service.py`, `annotation_manager.py`).
- **PyQt Testing Configuration:** For Qt-based components, use `pytest-qt` and configure tests with appropriate fixtures. Due to Qt's threading model and potential access violations, prefer testing components in isolation using mocks rather than full integration tests. For Qt worker threads, test the core logic methods directly rather than using the threaded execution to avoid race conditions and access violations.

### 6. Version Control

- **Commit Messages:** Follow a structured commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits) to clearly document changes. Example: `feat: Add annotation manager to handle sticky notes`.
