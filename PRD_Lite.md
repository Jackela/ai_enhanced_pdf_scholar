# Product Requirements: AI Enhanced PDF Scholar (Lite)

## 1. Background

Academic researchers, from PhD students to tenured professors, face a significant challenge in managing the overwhelming volume of research literature. Their current workflow is fragmented and inefficient, involving a patchwork of tools: a PDF reader for viewing, a reference manager for citations, and separate, often generic, AI chatbots for summarization or analysis. This constant context-switching wastes valuable time and hinders deep, connected understanding of the subject matter. AI Enhanced PDF Scholar aims to solve this by creating a single, intelligent platform that unifies document management, AI-powered analysis, and citation tracking.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

Our primary goal is to streamline the academic research process, making it faster, more insightful, and secure.

**Objective 1: Revolutionize the individual researcher's workflow.**
- **Key Result 1:** Reduce the average time spent on literature review tasks (finding information, managing citations) by 30%.
- **Key Result 2:** Achieve a user satisfaction (CSAT) score of over 90% for the core AI-powered Q&A feature.
- **Key Result 3:** Increase daily active users by 15% in the first quarter post-launch.

**Objective 2: Establish the platform as a credible and secure tool for academic use.**
- **Key Result 1:** Successfully pass a third-party security audit with zero critical vulnerabilities found.
- **Key Result 2:** Secure pilot programs with at least two university departments or research labs within six months.

## 3. User Personas

### Persona 1: Alex, The PhD Candidate
- **Who they are:** A 26-year-old Computer Science PhD candidate working on their dissertation. Tech-savvy but extremely time-poor.
- **Needs:** To quickly digest dozens of research papers for a literature review, pinpoint specific information across multiple documents, and manage citations without hassle.
- **Pain Points:** "I waste hours trying to find specific paragraphs in a sea of PDFs. I have to manually copy-paste text into a separate AI tool to get summaries, and I lose all the context and source tracking. I wish my PDF reader could just answer my questions directly."

### Persona 2: Dr. Chen, The Professor & Lab Lead
- **Who they are:** A 45-year-old tenured professor leading a university research lab. Responsible for guiding students and publishing high-impact research.
- **Needs:** To stay current with the latest findings, oversee student research, and ensure the integrity of sources. Data security and intellectual property are major concerns.
- **Pain Points:** "It's difficult to track the dozens of papers my students are citing. I need a trustworthy tool that respects data privacy and helps me understand the citation landscape to guide my students' research direction effectively."

## 4. User Stories

- **As Alex,** I want to upload a folder of PDFs and ask questions about the entire collection, so that I can quickly find the key concepts and data I need for my literature review.
- **As Alex,** I want the platform to automatically extract all citations from a paper and let me export them in BibTeX format, so that I can easily add them to my reference manager.
- **As Dr. Chen,** I want to see a visual map of how different papers are connected through citations, so that I can quickly grasp the foundational and recent works in a research area.
- **As Dr. Chen,** I want to be certain that the documents my lab uploads are stored securely and are not used to train any public AI models, so that I can protect our unpublished findings.

## 5. Scope

### In-Scope (Core Features for MVP)
- Secure user authentication and management.
- Upload, storage, and organization of PDF documents.
- Core RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality to ask questions of uploaded documents.
- Extraction of citations from documents into a manageable list.
- Secure and private storage of all user data.
- A clean, intuitive user interface for managing and interacting with documents.

### Out-of-Scope (For Future Versions)
- Real-time collaboration features (e.g., shared workspaces, live annotations).
- Integration with public academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed).
- A native mobile application.
- Advanced project management or team-based features.
- Proactive research recommendations based on user library.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Beyond the user-facing features, the platform must meet the following quality attributes to be considered production-ready and trustworthy.

### Performance
- **API Response Time:** The 95th percentile (P95) for all core API endpoints (document query, upload) must be under 250ms.
- **Frontend Load Time:** The initial page load (Largest Contentful Paint) for the main dashboard should be under 2 seconds.
- **RAG Query Speed:** The end-to-end time for a standard RAG query (from user submission to answer display) should average under 5 seconds.

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Users:** The system must support at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
- **Library Size:** A single user library should be able to handle up to 10,000 documents efficiently.

### Reliability
- **Service Availability:** All core services (API, document processing) must maintain 99.9% uptime.
- **Data Integrity:** Document and user data must be backed up regularly, with a defined point-in-time recovery plan to prevent data loss. No more than 5 minutes of data loss is acceptable in a disaster scenario.

### Security
- **Authentication & Authorization:** All API endpoints must be protected, and user data must be strictly segregated.
- **Data Encryption:** All user passwords must be hashed and salted using a strong algorithm (e.g., Argon2). Data at rest should be encrypted.
- **Web Security:** The platform must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10 (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.).
