                Machine Learning Fundamentals

                Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems 
                the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
                programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can 
                access data and use it to learn for themselves.

                Types of Machine Learning:
                1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function
                2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples
                3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment

                Key Algorithms:
                - Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
                - Decision Trees: Makes decisions through a tree-like model
                - Support Vector Machines: Finds optimal boundaries between classes
                - Neural Networks: Mimics brain structure for pattern recognition

                Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, 
                recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
